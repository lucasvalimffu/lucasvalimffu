## Hello there. Welcome!
Hello, my name is Lucas Valim and I'm mechanical engineer student, almost finishing the graduation degree.
## Interests:
I have great interest in programming, numerical calculus, software development, data science, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and mobile development.
## Achieviments and knowledges:
I already developed a lots of robots process automation (RPA) throughout my incipient career, some initiatives involving software development using mainly python. And I'm constantly using python and SQL for data analysis.
I'm already studied machine learning, deep learning and cybersecurity but I've never applied these knowledge in my routine yet, not suficiently.
